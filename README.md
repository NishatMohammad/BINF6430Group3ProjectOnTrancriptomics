# Transcriptomics Analysis for Knocked-Out Gene in Mice
## Overview
This README document provides an overview of the transcriptomics analysis performed for the knocked-out gene in mice. The purpose of this analysis is to understand the gene's impact on the transcriptome and identify differentially expressed genes, pathways, and potential regulatory mechanisms in response to the gene knockout.

## Analysis Pipeline
1. Data Preprocessing
Raw RNA-seq data was quality-checked using FastQC and MultiQC.
Reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (e.g., mm10) using HISAT.
Read counts were quantified using [xyz tool].
2. Differential Expression Analysis
Differential expression analysis was performed using [xyz tool].
The analysis compared knockout mice samples with control samples to identify upregulated and downregulated genes.
Statistical significance was determined based on [statistical test, e.g., DESeq2 or edgeR], with a predefined threshold (e.g., adjusted p-value < 0.05 and fold change > 2).
3. Functional Enrichment Analysis
Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses were carried out using [xyz tool name] to determine the biological functions and pathways associated with differentially expressed genes.
4. Network Analysis
Interaction networks of the differentially expressed genes were generated using [xyz tool].
Network analysis aimed to identify key regulatory genes and pathways affected by the gene knockout.
5. Visualization
Results were visualized using [xyz tool] to provide clear and interpretable graphics for data exploration and presentation.
Results
The analysis identified a set of differentially expressed genes and revealed significant changes in specific biological processes and pathways. The results of this analysis will contribute to a deeper understanding of the gene's role in mouse physiology and potential implications in disease or other biological contexts.

## Usage
Researchers interested in replicating or extending this analysis should follow the provided pipeline and tools, ensuring compatibility with their specific RNA-seq data and gene knockout model. Detailed scripts, parameters, and specific tool versions used in the analysis are available in the provided documentation.
